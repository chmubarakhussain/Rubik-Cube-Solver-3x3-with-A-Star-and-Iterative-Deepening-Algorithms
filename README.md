# Rubik-Cube-Solver-3x3-with-A-Star-and-Iterative-Deepening-Algorthms
The Rubik's Cube is an important test domain for heuristic search that has 1019 possible  states, making it impossible to store in memory. We are going to compare Iterative-Deepening and A* Algorithms for the  famous Rubikâ€™s cube puzzle. Comparison will be in terms of number of nodes expanded and  optimality of solution found by these search schemes.
